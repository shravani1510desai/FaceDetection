# FaceDetection
Face Detection is a simple computer vison project which focuses of  detecting face from the provided image by the user and displays a  new image show bounding box around the faces detected along with  confidence i.e., how accurately the face is detected, key points facial  mark such as left eye, right, eye, nose, mouth and providing this detail  in json format. I used flask for the frontend to make it user friendly in which I created  simple html form to receive the image from user and a submit button  to apply face detection pre trained model used at backend.
